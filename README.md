# halloween-twitter
Reads Twitter live stream for Halloween statuses

Uses python 3.
Requires Twython to be installed. https://twython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Get the API/token keys from your twitter account for use in the twitter streamer.

The ultimate aim for this project is to run this on a raspberry pi and connect some LEDs in a pumpkin.

The rate of LED flashes will indicate the activity of that keyword on Twitter!
